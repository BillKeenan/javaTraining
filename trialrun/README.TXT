Please take a few minutes to verify that you are able to run the Junit5 Tests
using your IDE. This file contains steps to run the example using IntelliJ, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new Java 8 project named java8lab.
2. Place the project anywhere you like.
3. Right click on java8lab in the Project window on the left and create a directory named test.
4. Right click on test, Mark Directory as | Test Sources Root
5. Create a package under test named com.agiledeveloper.
6. Create a package under src named com.agiledeveloper.
7. Copy TrialTest.java to java8lab/test/com/agiledeveloper
8. Copy Trial.java to java8lab/src/com/agiledeveloper
9. Right click on java8lab in the Project window and select Open Module Settings (or project settings).
10. In the Dependencies tab, select + and "Jars or directories..."
11. Navigate to the lib directory giving in the repository and select all the jar files under the lib/junit5 directory. Then Click OK.
12. Open the TrialTest.java file in the IDE.
13. Put the cursor within the class.
14. Select Run | Run and ask the IDE to run TrialTest.
15. Verify that the IDE reports one test as passing and one test as failing.
16. Now in TrialTest.java, change 
assertTrue(false);
to
assertTrue(true);
17. Repeat step 14 and verify that the IDE reports both tests as passing.

Please keep this project around. We will be using this project to build on each lab in the course as we go along.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse and create a new Java 8 project named java8lab.
2. Place the project anywhere you like.
3. Right click on java8lab in the Package Explorer on the left and create a Source Folder named test.
4. Create a package under test named com.agiledeveloper.
5. Create a package under src named com.agiledeveloper.
6. Copy TrialTest.java to java8lab/test/com/agiledeveloper
7. Copy Trial.java to java8lab/src/com/agiledeveloper
8. In the IDE, right click on java8lab in the Project Explorer and click Refresh. The two files we copied should now be visible in the IDE.
9. Right click on java8lab in the Package Explorer and select Properties.
10. Select Java Build Path. Then Libraries. Then Add External Jars.
11. Navigate to the lib directory giving in the repository and select all the jar files under the lib/junit5 directory. Then click on "Order and Export" and click on "Select All." Click OK.
12. Open the TrialTest.java file in the IDE.
13. Uncomment the lines
//import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

//@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)
14. Hover the mouse over RunWith and select "Add Junit4 library to the classpath."
15. Put the cursor within the class.
16. Select Run | Run and ask the IDE to run TrialTest.
17. Verify that the IDE reports one test as passing and one test as failing.
18. Now in TrialTest.java, change 
assertTrue(false);
to
assertTrue(true);
19. Repeat step 16 and verify that the IDE reports both tests as passing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using NetBeans

1. Open NetBeans and create a new Java 8 project named java8lab. Do not ask any main class to be created.
2. Place the project anywhere you like.
3. Right click on java8lab in the Projects window on the left and create a Folder named test.
4. Create a package under test named com.agiledeveloper.
5. Create a package under src named com.agiledeveloper.
6. Copy TrialTest.java to java8lab/test/com/agiledeveloper
7. Copy Trial.java to java8lab/src/com/agiledeveloper
8. Right click on java8lab in the Project window and select Properties.
9. Click on Libraries and then click on Add JAR/Folder. We will do this twice, once for step 10 and once for step 11.
10. Navigate to the lib directory giving in the repository and select all the jar files under the lib/junit5 directory.
11. In addition, navigate to the lib directory giving in the repository, go into the oldjunit and select the junit-4.12.jar file. Click OK.
12. Open the TrialTest.java file in the IDE.
13. Uncomment the lines
//import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

//@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)
14. Right click on TrialTest.java in the Project window and select "Test File."
15. Verify that the IDE reports one test as passing and one test as failing.
16. Now in TrialTest.java, change 
assertTrue(false);
to
assertTrue(true);
17. Repeat step 14 and verify that the IDE reports both tests as passing.
